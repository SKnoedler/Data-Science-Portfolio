## 1) Serverless Application: Automate your Job Search with AWS Lambda, CloudWatch, DynamoDB

In this short article (https://lnkd.in/d4BBqWE) I explain how you can build your own serverless application to automate your job search. The application crawls data from the job platform stepstone, extracts job titles and company names. I included an option to filter search results: Eliminate search results that include certain words in the job title, such as "Senior" positions. Filter company names and/ or specify words that must be included in the job title. The Application is scheduled with CloudWatch and stores data in a table in DynamoDB.
Python, Serverless Framework (Node.js), AWS Lambda, CloudWatch, DynamoDB
