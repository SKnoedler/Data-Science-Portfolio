# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and R markdown files (published at RPubs).

For a more visually pleasant experience for browsing the portfolio, check out [sknoedler.github.io](http://sknoedler.github.io)

_Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only._
