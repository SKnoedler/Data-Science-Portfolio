- ## Completed Academic Courses: 

	- #### Statistics (15 ECTS)
		- At the beginning, descriptive methods for preparation and analysis of
		economic data are provided. Then probability and distribution theory is
		introduced for the modeling of random. Moreover, estimation and testing
		methods are being studied that allow making data-driven economic
		decisions. In particular the linear regression model allows the measurement
		and modeling of economic contexts.
		
		- Descriptive methods of univariate data analysis; additional methods and
		correlation analysis; probability calculus; stochastic variables and
		distribution, distribution models; sums and means of sampling variables;
		parameter estimation; confidence intervals; statistical tests; further specific
		test problems; linear regression model
		
	- #### Mathematics (10ECTS)
		- The main focus areas of this course are linear algebra {including, amongst others, matrix calculus, matrix inverse, determinants of matrices, linear systems of equations, vector calculus), sequences and series as well as differential calculus {including, amongst others, differentiation of real functions, Taylor expansions, univariate and multivariate optimization of functions without and with constraint {Lagrange method). 
	- #### Databases (5 ECTS) [SQL]
		- This course offers an in-depth discussion of modern database system architectures and query language for use in databases. The focus lies on the relational databases model and relational query languages (SQL). Other topics covered are data integrity, integrity constraints, and database design.
	- #### Introduction to Data Science
		- [XYZ]
	- #### Navigating Complexity: Mapping, Visualisation & Decision- making
		- [XYZ]
	- #### Big Data Processes
		- [XYZ]
	- #### Foundations of Development of IT
		- [XYZ]
	- #### Marketing Analytics
		- [XYZ]
	- #### Introudction to Information Management (5 ECTS) [Python]
		- First, application systems and information systems as weil as the basic idea of standard business processes and their support by ERP systems are covered. The second part of the lecture addresses basic knowledge related to data management. The concept of data modeling is captured by an introduction to the Entity-Relationship-Model. The understanding of this basic topic is supplemented by the practical application of databases. Subsequently, an introduction to computers and programming is given, utilizing the programming language Python.
