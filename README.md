# Data Science Portfolio (under construction!)


----------- *The portfolio is incomplete, many additional pages & jupyter notebooks will be updated in June 2019* ----------- 


This is an overview of my Data Science knowledge as well as a brief summary of relevant projects which I completed for academic, self-learning, and hobby purposes.

If you like what you see here and you want to have a chat with me about my portfolio, work opportunities, or collaboration, write me an [email](mailto:st.knoedler@gmail.com). Please also take a look at my [Website](https://sknoedler.github.io) where you can find my CV as well as a more general description of my Data Science skills.


## 1) Projects
- ### Machine Learning [Python]
	- [k-Nearest-Neighbor](https://github.com/SKnoedler/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Nearest%20Neighbour%20Classfication.ipynb): 
	**To do:** In this project, I will perform classification with the nearest neighbor classifier, a non-linear, non-parametric method for classification. Then I will apply cross-validation for model selection and standard data normalization for preprocessing.
	**Data:** The data is taken from a number of images of wheat fields taken by a drone carrying a 3K by 4K Canon Powershot camera. The flying height was 30 meters. A number of image patches, all showing a field area of 3x3 meters were extracted. Approximately half of the patches showed crop, the remaining thistles. For each patch only the central 1x1 meter sub-patch is used for performance measurement. The full patch was presented to an expert from agriculture and classified as showing either weed (class 0) or only crop (class 1).

	_Tools: scikit-learn, Matplotlib_ 


- ### Data Analysis and Visualization [Python]
	- [Basics No.1](https://github.com/SKnoedler/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Basics%20No1.ipynb): Includes Mean, Hypothesis Testing, Correlation & Histograms
	- (...)

	_Tools: Python(Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib)_

- ### Academic Papers 
	- **Airbnb Data Analysis**: I am currently working on an analysis that covers an Airbnb dataset of over 31,000 data records. In this paper, I am applying the concept of Cross-industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM) when analyzing the dataset. The quantitative and qualitative analysis includes a variety of visualization (Python, Excel) as well as different regression models (including optimal selection of features). The report will be posted later.
	
	_Tools: Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SKlearn), Excel 365, Tableau_


- ### Independent Projects
	- [Deep Probabilistic Programming Post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/deep-probabilistic-programming-steffen-kn√∂dler/): One of our Data Science professors Thomas Hamelryck introduced us to Deep Probabilistic Programming (Deep PP) during a lecture in the second semester of my studies. This short blog post on LinkedIn introduces the idea of Deep PP and explains what it is  all about. I think Deep PP is a very exciting field of study and I cannot wait to learn more.
	- **Building a Web-Scraper to find a Data Science Job**: I have recently started working on building my first own web scraper. The goal of this small independent project is to automate my job search and integrate useful filters so that I only need to go through relevant job offerings. (Project will be continued in July & I will add the code as soon as possible)



## 2) Fundamentals
- ### Statistics (content will be added in June 2019)
	- **Statistical Features**: Bias, variance, mean, median, percentiles, and many other features explained.
	- **Probability Distributions**: Uniform- , Normal/ Gaussian- and Poisson Distribution will be explained here.
	- **Hypothesis Tests**: This section explains how the most common statistical hypothesis tests work as well as how to understand and interpret test values.
	- **Dimensionality Reduction**: This section explains the concept of dimensionality reduction.
	- **Frequency Statistics**: The concept of frequency statistics is explained.
	- **Bayesian Statistics**: The idea behind bayesion statistics and how it differs to frequency statistics.

- ### SQL (content will be added in June 2019)
	- **Examples of advanced SQL statements**: In this section, I will explain more advance SQL statements. Therefore, I skip the basics and show examples that are likely needed.
