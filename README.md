## 1) Projects
- ### Machine Learning [Python]
	- [k-Nearest-Neighbor](https://github.com/SKnoedler/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Nearest%20Neighbour%20Classfication.ipynb): 
	In this project, I will perform classification with the nearest neighbor classifier, a non-linear, non-parametric method for 		classification. Then I will apply cross-validation for model selection and standard data normalization for preprocessing.
	- [Multivariate Linear Regression](https://github.com/SKnoedler/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Multivariate%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb): Predict the quality score of red wine from its
physicochemical properties using linear regression.
	- [K-means](https://github.com/SKnoedler/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Jupyter%20Notebooks/KMeans%20Clustering.ipynb): This shows how K-Means can be used to do clustering
	- [Principal Component Analysis (PCA) I](https://github.com/SKnoedler/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Principal%20component%20analysis%20(PCA).ipynb): Here it is shown how PCA can be used as for reducing dimensionality and visualizing global dataset structure.
	- [Principal Component Analysis (PCA) II](https://github.com/SKnoedler/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Jupyter%20Notebooks/PCA%202.ipynb): Visualizing the spatial variance of the diatom cells by plotting some instances of the first three PC.
	- [Random Forest](https://github.com/SKnoedler/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Random%20Forest.ipynb): Train a random forest with 50 trees test the resulting classifier using test dat.
	_Tools: Python (scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib)_ 


- ### Data Analysis and Visualization [Python]
	- [Basics No.1](https://github.com/SKnoedler/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Basics%20No1.ipynb): Includes Mean, Hypothesis Testing, Correlation & Histograms

	_Tools: Python(Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib)_

- ### Academic Papers 
	- [AirBnB Analysis](https://github.com/SKnoedler/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Knowledge%20Collection/AirBnB%20Analysis.pdf): I am currently working on an analysis that covers an Airbnb dataset of over 31,000 data records. In this paper, I am applying the concept of Cross-industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM) when analyzing the dataset. The quantitative and qualitative analysis includes a variety of visualization (Python, Excel) as well as different regression models (including optimal selection of features). The report will be posted later.
	
	_Tools: Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SKlearn), Excel 365, Tableau_


- ### LinkedIn Articles
	- [Deep Probabilistic Programming Post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/deep-probabilistic-programming-steffen-kn√∂dler/): One of our Data Science professors Thomas Hamelryck introduced us to Deep Probabilistic Programming (Deep PP) during a lecture in the second semester of my studies. This short blog post on LinkedIn introduces the idea of Deep PP and explains what it is  all about. I think Deep PP is a very exciting field of study and I cannot wait to learn more.
	- [Job Web Crawler](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/data-project-who-looking-enthusiasts-frankfurt-germany-kn%C3%B6dler): A couple of days ago, I've decided to build my very first web crawler to collect information about jobs in my home city, Frankfurt. In this short post, I would like to share with you some knowledge about how to crawl data from webpages as well as some thoughts on the results of my very short analysis.


## 2) Fundamentals
- ### Statistics (content will be added in July 2019)
	- [Fundamentals](https://github.com/SKnoedler/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Knowledge%20Collection/Statistics%20Basics.pdf): mean, median, percentiles, and many other features explained.
	- **Probability Distributions**: Uniform- , Normal/ Gaussian- and Poisson Distribution will be explained here.
	- **Hypothesis Tests**: This section explains how the most common statistical hypothesis tests work as well as how to understand and interpret test values.
	- **Dimensionality Reduction**: This section explains the concept of dimensionality reduction.
	- **Frequency Statistics**: The concept of frequency statistics is explained.
	- **Bayesian Statistics**: The idea behind bayesion statistics and how it differs to frequency statistics.
