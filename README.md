- ## 2 Completed Academic Courses: 

	- #### Statistics (15 ECTS)
		- Descriptive methods of univariate data analysis; additional methods and
		correlation analysis; probability calculus; stochastic variables and
		distribution, distribution models; sums and means of sampling variables;
		parameter estimation; confidence intervals; statistical tests; further specific
		test problems; linear regression model
		
	- #### Mathematics (10ECTS)
		- The main focus areas of this course are linear algebra {including, amongst others, matrix calculus, matrix inverse, determinants of matrices, linear systems of equations, vector calculus), sequences and series as well as differential calculus {including, amongst others, differentiation of real functions, Taylor expansions, univariate and multivariate optimization of functions without and with constraint {Lagrange method). 
	- #### Databases (5 ECTS) [SQL]
		- This course offers an in-depth discussion of modern database system architectures and query language for use in databases. The focus lies on the relational databases model and relational query languages (SQL). Other topics covered are data integrity, integrity constraints, and database design.
	- #### Introduction to Data Science (7.5 ECTS) [Python]
		- The course covers the following tentative topic list: Foundations of statistical learning, probability theory; Classification methods, such as: Linear models, K-Nearest Neighbor; Regression methods, such as: Linear regression; Bayesian Statistics; Clustering.
Dimensionality reduction and visualization techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA).
	- #### Navigating Complexity: Mapping, Visualisation & Decision- making [Tableau]
		- The course will teach students to describe and analyse complexity within an empirical case that explores a current topic or controversy within the field of science, technology, and innovation. Students will be introduced to a range of conceptual and technical tools for generating and visualizing data and analyzing complexity. Throughout the course students will experiment with different techniques for generating data and visualizing complexity. Based on case work, students will be requested to reflect on how visualizations work as simplifications and can inform decision-making.
	- #### Big Data Processes (7.5 ECTS) [Tableau]
		- This course covers analytics and visualization (e.g., exploratory data analysis, classification, clustering), a specific application domains (e.g., marketing, financials, transportation), as well as challenges of Big Data processes (e.g., handling of personal data). Furthermore, you will practice communicating and presenting your results and reflections during the exercises in order to prepare for the oral exam. During the course you will learn to apply a number of software tools for analytics and visualization, such as Tableau and R.
	- #### Foundations of Development of IT [SQL]
		- This course covers and deals with each phase in the IT development cycle individually. The cycle will be broken down into themes: initiation, system concept development, planning, requirements analysis, design, code-based development, integration and test, implementation, operation and maintenance, and termination.
	- #### Marketing Analytics (6 ECTS)
		- The primary goal of this course is the learning of quantitative analytical methods and concepts that lead to the improvement of marketing decisions. In the lectures accompanying exercises and mentors, students gain the competence of independent application of analytical methods and concepts. In addition, the practical relevance of the learned methods and concepts is demonstrated by numerous case studies and practical lectures. 
	- #### Introudction to Information Management (5 ECTS) [Python]
		- First, application systems and information systems as weil as the basic idea of standard business processes and their support by ERP systems are covered. The second part of the lecture addresses basic knowledge related to data management. The concept of data modeling is captured by an introduction to the Entity-Relationship-Model. The understanding of this basic topic is supplemented by the practical application of databases. Subsequently, an introduction to computers and programming is given, utilizing the programming language Python.
	- #### Business Information Systems (6 ECTS) [SQL]
		- This course covers fundamentals, development, and introduction of information and communication systems for enterprises. It includes functionality and architecture and development of ICS as well as Business Process Reeingineering (BPR).
