	- (...)

	_Tools: Python(Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib)_

- ### Academic Papers 
	- **Airbnb Data Analysis**: I am currently working on an analysis that covers an Airbnb dataset of over 31,000 data records. In this paper, I am applying the concept of Cross-industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM) when analyzing the dataset. The quantitative and qualitative analysis includes a variety of visualization (Python, Excel) as well as different regression models (including optimal selection of features). The report will be posted later.
	
	_Tools: Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SKlearn), Excel 365, Tableau_


- ### Independent Projects
	- [Deep Probabilistic Programming](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/deep-probabilistic-programming-steffen-kn√∂dler/): One of our Data Science professors Thomas Hamelryck introduced us to Deep Probabilistic Programming (Deep PP) during a lecture in the second semester of my studies. This short blog post on LinkedIn introduces the idea of Deep PP and explains what it is  all about. I think Deep PP is a very exciting field of study and I cannot wait to learn more.
	- **Building a Web-Scraper to find a Data Science Job**: I have recently started working on building my first own web scraper. The goal of this small independent project is to automate my job search and integrate useful filters so that I only need to go through relevant job offerings. (Project will be continued in July & I will add the code as soon as possible)



## 2) Fundamentals
- ### Statistics (content will be added in June 2019)
	- **Statistical Features**: Bias, variance, mean, median, percentiles, and many other features explained.
	- **Probability Distributions**: Uniform- , Normal/ Gaussian- and Poisson Distribution will be explained here.
	- **Hypothesis Tests**: This section explains how the most common statistical hypothesis tests work as well as how to understand and interpret test values.
	- **Dimensionality Reduction**: This section explains the concept of dimensionality reduction.
	- **Frequency Statistics**: The concept of frequency statistics is explained.
	- **Bayesian Statistics**: The idea behind bayesion statistics and how it differs to frequency statistics.

- ### SQL (content will be added in June 2019)
	- **Examples of advanced SQL statements**: In this section, I will explain more advance SQL statements. Therefore, I skip the basics and show examples that are likely needed.




## 3) Academic Courses:
### *Upcoming Semester in Syracuse, USA:*
- #### Big Data Analytics [Python (Apache Spark, Hadoop 2.0, Spark ML, Pandas, Matplotlib)]
	- Students will learn to obtain, screen, clean, link, manipulate, analyze and display data while creating summaries, overviews, models, analyses and basic tables, histograms, trees and scattergrams. They will use Python and Apache Spark to explore classic and modern machine learning techniques (such as deep learning) within a big data context, including sentiment analysis via supervised learning, recommendation systems via unsupervised learning and predicting credit scoring via random forest machine learning.

- #### Fundamentals of Data Science
	- Fundamental methods for data science, such as regression, linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, k-means, principal component analysis, and nonlinear dimension reduction. Performance evaluation and model selection. Additional work required of graduate students.
	
- #### Managing Information Systems Projects
	- Project management as a professional discipline in information and communication technology. Introduction to roles, activities, methods, and tools. Critical review and application of principles. Additional work required of graduate students.

Students will be introduced to a range of conceptual and technical tools for generating and visualizing data and analyzing complexity. Throughout the course students will experiment with different techniques for generating data and visualizing complexity. Based on case work, students will be requested to reflect on how visualizations work as simplifications and can inform decision-making.
- #### Big Data Processes (7.5 ECTS) [Tableau]
	- This course covers analytics and visualization (e.g., exploratory data analysis, classification, clustering), as well as challenges of Big Data processes (e.g., handling of personal data). Furthermore, students will practice communicating and presenting of results as well as reflections during the exercises. Students learn to apply a number of software tools for analytics and visualization, such as Tableau and R.

The cycle will be broken down into themes: initiation, system concept development, planning, requirements analysis, design, code-based development, integration and test, implementation, operation and maintenance, and termination.
- #### Marketing Analytics (6 ECTS)
	- The primary goal of this course is the learning of quantitative analytical methods and concepts that lead to the improvement of marketing decisions. In the lectures accompanying exercises and mentors, students gain the competence of independent application of analytical methods and concepts. In addition, the practical relevance of the learned methods and concepts is demonstrated by numerous case studies and practical lectures. 
- #### Introduction to Information Management (5 ECTS) [Python]
