- ### Independent Projects
	- [Short Post about Deep Probabilistic Programming](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/deep-probabilistic-programming-steffen-kn√∂dler/): "This week, one of our Data Science professors Thomas Hamelryck introduced us to Deep Probabilistic Programming (Deep PP). Until lately, I have not heard much about this topic but it has caught my interest now. Deep PP aims to combine the advantages of Deep Learning and PP. So what is it about?"


- ## 3) Academic Courses: 

	- #### Statistics (15 ECTS)
		- Descriptive methods of univariate data analysis; additional methods and
		correlation analysis; probability calculus; stochastic variables and
		distribution, distribution models; sums and means of sampling variables;
		parameter estimation; confidence intervals; statistical tests; further specific
		test problems; linear regression model
		
	- #### Mathematics (10ECTS)
		- The main focus areas of this course are linear algebra {including, amongst others, matrix calculus, matrix inverse, determinants of matrices, linear systems of equations, vector calculus), sequences and series as well as differential calculus {including, amongst others, differentiation of real functions, Taylor expansions, univariate and multivariate optimization of functions without and with constraint {Lagrange method). 
	- #### Databases (5 ECTS) [SQL]
		- This course offers an in-depth discussion of modern database system architectures and query language for use in databases. The focus lies on the relational databases model and relational query languages (SQL). Other topics covered are data integrity, integrity constraints, and database design.
	- #### Introduction to Data Science (7.5 ECTS) [Python]
		- The course covers the following tentative topic list: Foundations of statistical learning, probability theory; Classification methods, such as: Linear models, K-Nearest Neighbor; Regression methods, such as: Linear regression; Bayesian Statistics; Clustering.
Dimensionality reduction and visualization techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA).
	- #### Navigating Complexity: Mapping, Visualisation & Decision- making (15 ECTS) [Tableau, Gephi, WebCrawler]
		- The course will teach students to describe and analyse complexity within an empirical case. Students will be introduced to a range of conceptual and technical tools for generating and visualizing data and analyzing complexity. Throughout the course students will experiment with different techniques for generating data and visualizing complexity. Based on case work, students will be requested to reflect on how visualizations work as simplifications and can inform decision-making.
	- #### Big Data Processes (7.5 ECTS) [Tableau]
		- This course covers analytics and visualization (e.g., exploratory data analysis, classification, clustering), as well as challenges of Big Data processes (e.g., handling of personal data). Furthermore, students will practice communicating and presenting of results as well as reflections during the exercises. Students learn to apply a number of software tools for analytics and visualization, such as Tableau and R.
	- #### Foundations of Development of IT [SQL]
		- This course covers and deals with each phase in the IT development cycle individually. The cycle will be broken down into themes: initiation, system concept development, planning, requirements analysis, design, code-based development, integration and test, implementation, operation and maintenance, and termination.
	- #### Marketing Analytics (6 ECTS)
		- The primary goal of this course is the learning of quantitative analytical methods and concepts that lead to the improvement of marketing decisions. In the lectures accompanying exercises and mentors, students gain the competence of independent application of analytical methods and concepts. In addition, the practical relevance of the learned methods and concepts is demonstrated by numerous case studies and practical lectures. 
	- #### Introduction to Information Management (5 ECTS) [Python]
		- Application systems and information systems as well as business processes and their support by ERP systems are covered. In addition, the lectures address basic knowledge related to data management as well as the concept of data modeling. Subsequently, an introduction programming is given, utilizing the programming language Python.
	- #### Business Information Systems (6 ECTS) [SQL]
		- This course covers fundamentals, development, and introduction of information and communication systems for enterprises. It includes functionality and architecture and development of ICS as well as Business Process Reeingineering (BPR).
